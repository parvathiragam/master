MAMP PRO
MAMP PRO is the commercial, professional frontend for the classic local server environment: MAMP. With MAMP PRO you can create a separate host for each of your web projects. Install WordPress with only one click and after completion of your page, publish it directly from MAMP PRO on your live server. This is just a small part of what you can do with MAMP PRO.
